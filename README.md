# Boom Bike
> A comprehensive analysis project aimed at understanding key factors influencing bike rentals.

## Table of Contents

## General Information
- This project focuses on exploring and analyzing the factors affecting bike rentals using the Boom Bike dataset (`day.csv`).
- Key steps include data preprocessing, visualization, and building Linear Reagression Model.
- The primary goal is to uncover patterns and correlations that can inform better decision-making for optimizing bike rentals.

## Technologies Used
- Python (3.x)
- Pandas (Version used in the notebook)
- NumPy (Version used in the notebook)
- Visualization libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## Observations:
- Linear Trend: The points exhibit a clear linear trend, indicating that the model is effectively capturing the relationship between the features and the target variable.
  
-Prediction Accuracy: Many points are close to the diagonal line (y = x), reflecting the model's strong prediction accuracy.

-Residual Spread: The residuals are evenly distributed around the diagonal, suggesting a consistent error rate across different values of y_test.

-Outliers: While most points align well with the diagonal, the plot predominantly showcases good model performance with only a few exceptions.

-Model Fit: The tight clustering of points around the diagonal demonstrates that the model's predictions align closely with the actual values.

## Conclusions
-Train Set r2=0.824: The model explains 82.4% of the variance in the training data.

-Test Set r2=0.802: The model explains 80.2% of the variance in the unseen test data

-The close r2 values for train and test datasets suggest this model performs consistently and generalizes well to new data. And also Adjusted R-squared value of 0.821 means 
  the MLR model explains 82.1% of the target variable's variability after considering the predictors. This indicates strong model performance
